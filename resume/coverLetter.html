        <p>Dear <em>Hiring Manager</em>,</p>
        <p>
          I am excited to apply for the <strong>Software QA Engineer</strong> position at your company. With over five years of hands-on experience in quality assurance and test automation, I bring a proven track record of delivering reliable, high-quality software through efficient and scalable testing practices.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I’ve worked extensively with tools such as <mark>Selenium</mark>, <mark>Cypress</mark>, and <mark>Postman</mark>, developing and maintaining automation frameworks that significantly reduced testing time while improving overall product stability. My test strategies have consistently enhanced team productivity and supported smooth Agile workflows.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Most recently at <strong>Code/+/Trust</strong>, I led the development of both manual and automated test suites, resulting in a <strong> 20% reduction of delays</strong> and faster, more reliable product releases. This role sharpened my ability to collaborate closely with developers, project managers, and stakeholders to ensure quality at every stage.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I’m particularly drawn to your company’s emphasis on innovation and quality. I’m confident that my attention to detail, proactive mindset, and commitment to continuous improvement make me a strong fit for your team.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to your QA initiatives and support your team’s success.
        </p>
      
        <p>Sincerely,<br><strong>Fawzia Masud</strong></p>
